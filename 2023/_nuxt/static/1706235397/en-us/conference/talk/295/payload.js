In this talk we'll explore the power of intuitive Python libraries for I\u002FO, then use them to automatically beat an in-browser video game using the same strategies and inputs as a human. We’ll also discuss applying basic project management skills to take personal projects from ideas to successes. Whether you want to help robots take over the world or a good reminder of why you have to prove you’re human online, this talk is for you!";b.detailed_description="In this talk, I'll walk through my process of developing a script which can automatically beat the in-browser video game [Mamono Sweeper by Hojamaka Games](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.hojamaka.com\u002Fgame\u002Fmamosui_list.html). The game itself is a cross between minesweeper and an RPG, and is unknown enough that figuring out the strategies to win was enjoyable. I love the game but eventually I’d mostly lose due to careless mistakes. As a programmer, I wanted to see whether I could automate the whole process. I'll go through the loop to take in visual data, process that data, then use the result to interact with the computer via mouse inputs. I'll also examine the factors that led to me completing this project instead of quitting halfway through.\r\n\r\nLibraries of interest:\r\n* [MSS](https:\u002F\u002Fpypi.org\u002Fproject\u002Fmss\u002F1.0.2\u002F)\r\n* [OpenCV2](https:\u002F\u002Fpypi.org\u002Fproject\u002Fopencv-python\u002F)\r\n* [PyAutoGUI](https:\u002F\u002Fpypi.org\u002Fproject\u002FPyAutoGUI\u002F)\r\n\r\nBlog writeups:\r\n* https:\u002F\u002Fmedium.com\u002Fhenngeblog\u002Fautomating-victory-beating-browser-games-with-accessible-python-part-1-1a371d9e9234\r\n* https:\u002F\u002Fmedium.com\u002Fhenngeblog\u002Fautomating-victory-beating-browser-games-with-accessible-python-part-2-181134e8b589";b.slide_link=a;b.slido_embed_link="https:\u002F\u002Fapp.sli.do\u002Fevent\u002F5MVU4a4xv5R14t2g3HeA8R";b.hackmd_embed_link="https:\u002F\u002Fhackmd.io\u002F@pycontw\u002FSyzuUi7p2";b.speakers=[{thumbnail_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftw.pycon.org\u002Fprs\u002Fmedia\u002Fcache\u002F75\u002F9c\u002F759c54c6c95e2c1a023e15f8aed48767.jpg",name:"Jon Gaul",github_profile_url:a,twitter_profile_url:a,facebook_profile_url:a,bio:"Graduating from Georgia Tech with a dual degree in Computer Science and Chemical Engineering, Jon has long held a passion for investigating how the world works and how theory transforms into practice.\r\n\r\nThis sense of curiosity has led him to Tokyo, Japan, where he works as a software engineer at HENNGE.
