They bring together people who share common altruistic goals, and the magic of collaboration and innovation flourishes. However, despite the abundance of positive outcomes, community stewards often face challenges such as burnout and succession planning. So the question remains: how do we make this good thing last?\r\n\r\nManaging a long-running organization is not easy but it can also be very fulfilling. By prioritizing leadership development and implementing measures to prevent burnout, we can ensure that our open source communities endure and continue to make an impact.";b.detailed_description="As co-founders of Python Philippines (PythonPH), we've faced numerous challenges, including the departure of team members without a succession plan, having to take additional workloads, and experiencing burnout. In this talk, we'll share our personal journey and offer strategies that have helped us overcome these pain points.\r\n\r\nWe understand first-hand the uncertainty and pressure that come with the loss of co-founders and how it can impact the remaining team members. Drawing from our experience, we'll share the steps we took in creating a succession plan that will ensure continuity and minimize disruption.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we'll discuss how we've dealt with burnout and share tips for maintaining a healthy work-life-community balance. As we've navigated these challenges, we've also faced feelings of being left behind from a shared mission. We'll offer insights on how we stay motivated and focused on achieving organizational goals, even when it feels like others have moved on.\r\n\r\nThis talk will provide attendees with a personal account of the challenges and rewards of managing a long-running organization:\r\n\r\n1.
