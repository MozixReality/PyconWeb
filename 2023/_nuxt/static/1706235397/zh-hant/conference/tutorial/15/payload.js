But it isn't always obvious how to create them in Pandas, or what options are available. \r\n\r\nIn this tutorial, I'll explain everything you need to know about pivot tables — how (and why) to create them, and what sorts of analysis you can (and should) do.\r\n\r\nMoreover, you'll build some pivot tables yourself, using real-world data, in a number of hands-on exercises.";b.detailed_description="People talk a lot about pivot tables — sometimes because they are familiar with them from other systems (such as Excel), and sometimes because they've just heard about them.\r\n\r\nAnd then they get to Pandas, and they're confused about how to create them, or even why to do that.\r\n\r\nIn this workshop, I'll help people really understand pivot tables -- why we want them, how to build them, how to think about them, and how best to use them.  There will be several hands-on exercises at which people will really build them with real-world data.  And of course, there will be time for questions, to make sure that no one leaves confused.\r\n\r\nBy the time people finish with this workshop, they'll be ready to use pivot tables in their day-to-day work.";b.slide_link=a;b.slido_embed_link="https:\u002F\u002Fapp.sli.do\u002Fevent\u002FaNMNnnw9nDiRApvSSwrsr6";b.hackmd_embed_link="https:\u002F\u002Fhackmd.io\u002F@pycontw\u002FH1c8LsXpn";b.speakers=[{thumbnail_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftw.pycon.org\u002Fprs\u002Fmedia\u002Fcache\u002Fa1\u002Fb5\u002Fa1b59885025365453010497e0e846ecb.jpg",name:"Reuven M.
