One of the most common request is to help students doing their research investigatory project integrate coding and programming as our school doesn't have any robotics or programming related class offering.\r\n\r\nWhen I started my masters degree, I know for sure that I won't have that much time to help them so I told them, \"Hey, can you just create a python class for students\"? And to my surprise, they did!\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll discuss the challenges of implementing and adding a new course to an existing curriculum. Not to mention the difficulty of having limited resources like computers, budget, etc. It's a nightmare! But we made it happen regardless.";a.detailed_description="In order to understand the core problem, I will first give a glimpse of the education system here in the Philippines. This is to cement the underlying need for implementing a programming class for high school students.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of factors that we need to consider when we were planning this class. It might seem simple and straightforward but we had to adjust the coverage and scope of what we want to offer due to the needs of the students and the school. We encountered a lot of problems including how to pick the correct teachers and how to teach the teachers themselves. As for the students, we want to make sure that they can use what they will learn in their research and projects. \r\n\r\nIt has been a couple of years since the school added programming classes and they were able to offer it to different grade level already. We have some insights on how it affected the students and how it made them more inclined towards STEM (Science, technology, engineering, maths).";a.slide_link=b;a.slido_embed_link="https:\u002F\u002Fapp.sli.do\u002Fevent\u002Fb3ZQQBYQ6U8p8syYTAhux4";a.hackmd_embed_link="https:\u002F\u002Fhackmd.io\u002F@pycontw\u002FrkqD8om62";a.speakers=[{thumbnail_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftw.pycon.org\u002Fprs\u002Fmedia\u002Fcache\u002F2d\u002F5a\u002F2d5ace8ea6cb56428bedc7380198ae35.jpg",name:"Ni√±o R.
