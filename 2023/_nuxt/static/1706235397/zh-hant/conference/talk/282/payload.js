In addition, projects that are based on Apache Beam are often properly-sized, this makes the work to be implemented in a short duration, so interns are suitable for this type of work.\r\n\r\nThe speaker will introduce Apache Beam and provide their experience on intern project planning along with the expectation and business impact consideration. If you want to know what it is and what problems are solved by Apache Beam, or if you want to learn how to design an (intern) project, this talk is for you.";b.detailed_description="Why PyCon Taiwan?\r\n* Apache Beam is rarely mentioned in PyCon Taiwan.\r\n* Apache Beam provides well Python support, and can be used under Colab (Jupyter-liked) environment.
