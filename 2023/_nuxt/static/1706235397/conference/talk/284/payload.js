Compared to the imperative way how data engineers build ETL\u002FELT data pipelines in the last decade, layered data architecture could be of great help in improving data quality steadily and progressively, and reducing data silos while project-specific teams are autonomously producing various data products. We will introduce, in this share, a technical solution based on layered data architecture. The solution is implemented by means of Dagster, a cloud-native data orchestrator with integrated lineage, observability, and a declarative programming model. A simple example will be presented in this talk to demonstrate concepts, principles, and data stack of the solution. In the end, the benefits we have gained from the implementation experience will be conveyed as well.",detailed_description:"### 與 Layered Data Architecture 相關的資訊\r\n\r\n- [Medallion Architecture] Databricks 所提出的 multi-hop data design pattern\r\n- [Modern Data Architecture] Snowflake 所提出的 modern data architecture\r\n\r\n### 使用的第三方工具：\r\n\r\n- [Dagster] 為實現 layered data architecture 所使用的 data orchestration 工具\r\n\r\n[Medallion Architecture]: https:\u002F\u002Fwww.databricks.com\u002Fglossary\u002Fmedallion-architecture\r\n[Modern Data Architecture]: https:\u002F\u002Fwww.snowflake.com\u002Fblog\u002Fbeyond-modern-data-architecture\u002F\r\n[Dagster]: https:\u002F\u002Fdagster.io",slide_link:"https:\u002F\u002F1drv.ms\u002Fp\u002Fs!AtNklwocKzYg8AEp6C6A-0jq8XN6?e=3ZFwU6",slido_embed_link:"https:\u002F\u002Fapp.sli.do\u002Fevent\u002Fu6FKx99uik2i9pyfJi9FAP",hackmd_embed_link:"https:\u002F\u002Fhackmd.io\u002F@pycontw\u002FHJ7SUiXp2",speakers:[{thumbnail_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftw.pycon.org\u002Fprs\u002Fmedia\u002Fcache\u002F70\u002Fc9\u002F70c9817310a0512ea77013c2de5b9357.jpg",name:"George T.

In the recent 7 years, I have been focusing on Data Architect, team management, and DevOps. As to technical experience, I got 6 years on Hadoop ecosystem, especially on Hortonworks HDP, 7 years on Kubernetes and 4 years on AWS\u002FGCP. My personal vision is to make each data practitioner have a better life. I am approaching the vision by exploring new tools, discovering best practices, and delivering well-designed data architectures and technical solutions for data practitioners to relief their pain points and frustrations when coping with data."}],event_type:"talk"}}],fetch:{},mutations:[]}}("")));
