This is crucial for ensuring that AI systems are transparent, accountable, and trustworthy, and do not make biased or discriminatory decisions. Python offers various libraries that can be used to improve the interpretability of AI algorithms in a variety of situations, such as enhancing transparency in decision-making systems or facilitating communication between AI experts and non-experts. In this hands-on tutorial, you will learn how to use these tools to improve the interpretability of AI algorithms in Python, and explore key metrics and evaluation methods for measuring the effectiveness of XAI techniques. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a better understanding of how to make your AI systems more transparent and trustworthy.",detailed_description:"In this tutorial, we will explore the concept of Explainable AI and its importance for ensuring the transparency, accountability, and trustworthiness of AI systems. We will also provide a hands-on tutorial on using Python tools, such as Shapley and lime, to improve the interpretability of AI algorithms. The tutorial will cover key metrics and evaluation methods for measuring the effectiveness of XAI techniques, and will provide attendees with the knowledge and skills needed to implement these techniques in their own projects.\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall, this tutorial is intended for developers, data scientists, and AI experts who are interested in learning more about Explainable AI and how to use Python to improve the interpretability and transparency of AI systems. By attending this tutorial, attendees will gain a deeper understanding of the challenges and opportunities associated with Explainable AI, and will learn how to use Python to enhance the interpretability of AI algorithms and models.",slide_link:a,slido_embed_link:"https:\u002F\u002Fapp.sli.do\u002Fevent\u002F6CSRaeDADdcm74k9ywbkzJ",hackmd_embed_link:"https:\u002F\u002Fhackmd.io\u002F@pycontw\u002FHyFX8omph",speakers:[{thumbnail_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftw.pycon.org\u002Fprs\u002Fmedia\u002Fcache\u002F08\u002F81\u002F08817d20d3d51b3ea8ff9f3f83cfeecd.jpg",name:"Neeraj Pandey",github_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fneerajp99",twitter_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fneerajp99",facebook_profile_url:a,bio:"Neeraj is a polyglot and open-source contributor.
